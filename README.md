## Inspiration
People With disabilities especially the ones who can't speak face find it challenging to face the real world. 

## What it does
Our app takes input from the user as text and the app speak it on his/her behalf.
## How we built it
We built using flutter and using flutter_tts in pub

## Challenges we ran into
We had problems physically debugging the app on a real device. But this was eventually sorted out.
We attempted to create speech to text as well but could not do it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making an app in 24hrs. We had never done it before.

## What we learned
We learnt how to collaborate and work as a team in making the project.

## What's next for YOLO
We plant to add speech to text as an upcoming feature.
